== How to...

==== Collapse to single cursor after using multiple cursors / Keep only primary cursor
- Use the default keybind `,` bound to the `keep_primary_selection` command.

==== Change cursor shape on mode change (bar cursor on insert mode, block on normal mode, etc)

- Add this to your https://docs.helix-editor.com/configuration.html#configuration[`config.toml`]:
+
[source,toml]
----
[editor.cursor-shape]
insert = "bar"
normal = "block"
select = "underline"
----

==== Map `jk` or `jj` to exit insert mode

- Add this to your https://docs.helix-editor.com/configuration.html#configuration[`config.toml`]:
+
[source,toml]
----
[keys.insert]
j = { k = "normal_mode" }
----

==== Use my terminal's 16 color palette as a theme

- You can use color names like `red`, `light-blue`, etc to refer to
the terminal's colors in a theme file; refer the
https://docs.helix-editor.com/themes.html#color-palettes[theme color palette]
documentation.

==== Perform find-and-replace

- Type `%` to select the entire file, then `s` to bring up a `select:` prompt. Enter your search, and press enter. All matches in the file will be selected; you can now use `c` to change them all simultaneously.

To make search fully case sensitive add the following to `config.toml`:
```
[editor.search]
smart-case = false
```

==== Strip whitespace or format the buffer

If the LSP for the language is active and supports autoformat, and the auto-format option is on (check your and the repo's `languages.toml`), then this will happen on save. If there is an alternative command you can run in the terminal to format, you can pipe the whole buffer to it manually with `%|<formatter><enter>`.

==== Access the Helix config directory

You can use `:config-open` to open the config in Helix.

==== Access the log file

Enable logging via the `-v` flag, with each use (up to `-vvv`) increasing the verbosity.

You can use `:log-open` to open the log in Helix.

==== Add a language

Check https://docs.helix-editor.com/guides/adding_languages.html

==== Change grammars at project level

You can specify custom grammars per-project/per-directory by placing the `languages.toml` in `.helix/languages.toml` at the root of your project. See https://docs.helix-editor.com/languages.html

==== Close the LSP documentation popup

`Ctrl-c` closes popups like LSP signature-help, hover, and auto-completion.

== General Questions

==== How to write plugins / Is there a plugin system in place yet ?

* Current status as of December 2022:
____
There's two prototypes we're exploring that could potentially exist side by side: a typed list/ML-like implementation for scripting and a Rust based interface for things that require performance. Could potentially run both in wasm but I'm personally a bit unhappy with how big wasm implementations are, easily several orders of magnitude compared to the editor

==== When will the next release be?

We shoot to cut a release around every two to three months. We use CalVer versioning, so if the current release is v22.08, it was released in August of 2022.

== Installation

=== Error when building tree-sitter language grammars in Fedora

Ensure that you have a C compiler installed:

```shell
sudo dnf group install "C Development Tools and Libraries"
```

== Common Issues

=== `Alt-*` key combinations do not work on MacOS iTerm2

Ensure that you have mapped the Option key to `ESC+` in the iTerm2 preferences via Preferences > Profiles > Keys
